===============================

AREA 1:

King Runt (Champion of peons) - A large, Fat Runt. Later in the game, it is revealed that he is the Devil who became
a Runt because his incarnation was foiled by a foolish knight of the King.

Crit. Chance: 4%

Crack Attack: Super Squish:
King Runt stretches out as far as he can to make himself as big as possible, then topples over and 
flattens the player as well as anyone else in the party. Deals tremendous damage and can kill.

Kafkin (The Black Joker) (FINAL) - A rejected court jester turned insane after he allowed demons 
into his body in his quest to seek revenge against the King of Rhydnyl for rejecting him as a jester.

Crack Attack: Fake-Out:
Kafkin uses a Satanic ritual to summon 5 variations of himself to disguise himself. 
There are small differences between the copy and the real Kafkin. Attacking the real Kafkin will kill all of the other copys,
whereas attacking a fake gives the real Kafkin a free hit on the player, and that hit is a brutal one.

Aryndul charges up a powerful punch over 3 attacks. When it is ready, he will unleash the attack on the party,
dealing devastating damage and stunning those who don't die from it. However, he becomes stunned for longer than
the player, which allows the player to recover with heals if they have any.
